# Fourier Series Visualization

This project visualizes a Fourier series representation of a square wave using p5.js. The application displays a specified number of circles on the left side, where each circle represents a harmonic of the wave. The endpoint of the last circle serves as the starting point for a line that draws the resulting square wave on the right.

## Features

- Dynamic visualization of circles representing the Fourier series harmonics.
- Real-time drawing of the resulting square wave based on the defined number of circles.
- Adjustable parameters for the number of circles and their rotation speed.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The user specifies the number of circles to visualize.
2. **Circle Display**: The circles are displayed on the left side of the canvas.
3. **Wave Drawing**: A line begins at the endpoint of the last circle and draws the corresponding square wave to the right of the circles.
4. **Visualization**: The entire process is visualized using p5.js, allowing users to see how the Fourier series approximates the square wave in real-time.
