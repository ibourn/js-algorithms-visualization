# Quick Sort Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization of the Quick Sort algorithm using p5.js. Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that employs the "divide and conquer" strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

## Features

- Visual representation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
- Step-by-step animation of the sorting process.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: An array of random numbers is generated for sorting.
2. **Choosing a Pivot**: A pivot element is selected from the array.
3. **Partitioning**: The array is partitioned into two sub-arrays based on the pivot, with elements less than the pivot on one side and elements greater than the pivot on the other side.
4. **Recursive Sorting**: The algorithm recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
5. **Visualization**: Each step of the sorting process is visualized using p5.js, allowing users to see how the algorithm sorts the array in real-time.
