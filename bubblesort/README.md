# Bubble Sort Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm using p5.js. The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Features

- Visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- Step-by-step animation of the sorting process.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: An array of random numbers is generated for sorting.
2. **Sorting Process**: The algorithm iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order.
3. **Visualization**: Each step of the sorting process is visualized using p5.js, allowing users to see how the algorithm sorts the array in real-time.
